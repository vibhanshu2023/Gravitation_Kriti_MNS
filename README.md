Abstract

Gravitational waves are 'ripples' in space-time caused by some of the most violent and energetic processes in the Universe. Albert Einstein first theorized the presence of gravitational waves in 1916 within his General Theory of Relativity. Einstein's mathematics revealed that the movement of massive accelerating objects, such as neutron stars or black holes orbiting each other, would create a disturbance in space-time, causing ripples of undulating space-time to spread in all directions from the source. The momentous finding of gravitational waves took place in 2015, when the Laser Interferometer Gravitational-Wave Observatory (LIGO) detectors, located in Washington and Louisiana, successfully detected them using ground-based facilities. When a gravitational wave is detected, the arms of LIGO also experience fluctuations in length. As a result, the lasers within the arms travel varying distances before coming together again. The technical term for this oscillation is "Differential Arm" motion, since the arms simultaneously change lengths in opposing ways. Now, as the beams recombine, they are out of sync, or "out of phase", and no longer totally destructively interfere. Instead, the merging beams shift in and out of phase, and a flicker of light emerges from the interferometer. Traveling at the speed of light, these cosmic ripples provide valuable insights into the true nature of gravity and reveal information about their origins, making them a fascinating area of study for scientists.
Theoretical Construct
Let,
•
Mass of first body = 𝑚1
•
Mass of second body = 𝑚2
•
Distance between the bodies = 𝑟
•
Angular frequency of revolution = 𝜔
•
Distance of 𝑚1 from the centre of mass of the system, 𝑟1=𝑚2𝑟𝑚1+𝑚2
•
Distance of 𝑚2 from the centre of mass of the system, 𝑟2 =𝑚1𝑟𝑚1+𝑚2
⇒ Instantaneous velocity of first body, 𝑣1= 𝜔𝑟1= 𝑚2𝑟𝜔𝑚1+𝑚2
⇒ Instantaneous velocity of second body, 𝑣2= 𝜔𝑟2= 𝑚1𝑟𝜔𝑚1+𝑚2
Now, the Centripetal force on each mass is equal to the Gravitational force experienced by them respectively
∴𝐹𝑔𝑟𝑎𝑣𝑖𝑡𝑎𝑡𝑖𝑜𝑛=𝐺𝑚1𝑚2r2=m1r1ω2=𝐹𝑐𝑒𝑛𝑡𝑟𝑖𝑝𝑒𝑡𝑎𝑙 ----- (here 𝐺= Gravitational constant) ⇒𝐺𝑚1𝑚2𝑟2=𝑚1𝑚2𝑟𝜔2𝑚1+𝑚2 ⇒𝐺(𝑚1+𝑚2)𝑟3=𝜔2 ⇒𝜔=√𝐺(𝑚1+𝑚2)𝑟3
Assuming that relativistic effects are negligible,
Total energy, 𝐸=𝐾𝑖𝑛𝑒𝑡𝑖𝑐 𝑒𝑛𝑟𝑔𝑦+𝑃𝑜𝑡𝑒𝑛𝑡𝑖𝑎𝑙 𝐸𝑛𝑒𝑟𝑔𝑦 ⇒𝐸=12𝑚1𝑣22+12𝑚2𝑣22−𝐺𝑚1𝑚2𝑟 ⇒𝐸=12𝑚1(𝐺(𝑚1+𝑚2)𝑟3)(𝑚2𝑟𝑚1+𝑚2)2+12𝑚2(𝐺(𝑚1+𝑚2)𝑟3)(𝑚1𝑟𝑚1+𝑚2)2−𝐺𝑚1𝑚2𝑟 ∴𝐸=−𝐺𝑚1𝑚22𝑟
Substituting r from ω=√𝐺(𝑚1+𝑚2)𝑟3 ⇒𝐸=(𝐺𝑚1𝑚22)(ω2𝐺(𝑚1+𝑚2))1/3
⇒𝐸=−(𝐺ω)23𝑚1𝑚22(𝑚1+𝑚2)13 ⇒𝐸=−(𝐺ω(𝑚1+𝑚2))23𝑚1𝑚22(𝑚1+𝑚2) ⇒𝐸=−(𝐺ω(𝑚1+𝑚2))23𝜇2
Here, 𝜇=𝑚1𝑚2𝑚1+𝑚2 which is the reduced mass of the system
Power radiated through electromagnetic waves by a time-varying dipole is given by Larmor’s formula: 𝑃𝐸𝑊=ω4|pω|212𝜋𝜀𝑐𝑣2 𝑃𝐸𝑊=kω4|pω|23𝑐𝑣2
Where,
𝑃𝐸𝑊: Power radiated through electromagnetic waves
𝑝𝜔: Dipole moment
𝜀: Permittivity of the medium
c: Speed of light
𝑣: Wave speed (=c for both electromagnetic and gravitational waves)
𝑘: Coulomb’s constant
Comparing with Larmor’s formula, the power radiated by gravitational waves (𝑃𝐺𝑊) are expected to rely on:
𝐺: The gravitational constant is equivalent to k
𝜔: The angular frequency of the system (as Gravitational waves are produced by the revolution/oscillation of the masses)
𝑐: Speed of light=Speed of the gravitational waves
𝑄: The quadrupole moment of the binary system≡Moment of inertia of the system
𝑄 is equivalent to pω in Larmor’s formula
Moment of inertia, |Q|=𝑚1𝑟12+𝑚2𝑟22 ⇒𝑄=𝑚1(𝑚2𝑟𝑚1+𝑚2)2+𝑚2(𝑚1𝑟𝑚1+𝑚2)2 ⇒𝑄=𝑚1𝑚2𝑟2𝑚1+𝑚2 ⇒|𝑄|=𝜇𝑟2
Where, 𝜇=𝑚1𝑚2𝑚1+𝑚2 : Reduced mass of the system
Power radiated by electromagnetic radiation is proportional to the square of dipole moment. 𝑃𝐸𝑊∝|pω|2
Comparing the given formula with gravitational waves, 𝑃𝐺𝑊∝|𝑄|2
∴Power radiated,𝑃𝐺𝑊=𝛼𝐺𝑎𝜔𝑏(𝜇𝑟2)2𝑐𝑑 ------ (𝛼 is the proportionality constant)
Comparing the dimensions of the quantities, ⇒[ML2T−3] =[M−1L3T−2]a .[T−1]b .[ML2]2 .[LT−1]d ⇒1=−𝑎+2

∴𝑎=1,𝑑=−5,𝑏=6
Given: Constant of proportionality, 𝛼=32/5 ∴𝑃𝑜𝑤𝑒𝑟 𝑒𝑚𝑖𝑡𝑡𝑒𝑑 𝑏𝑦 𝑔𝑟𝑎𝑣𝑖𝑡𝑎𝑡𝑖𝑜𝑛𝑎𝑙 𝑤𝑎𝑣𝑒𝑠,𝑃𝐺𝑊=325𝐺𝜔6𝜇2𝑟4 𝑐5
For a Binary System
Now, 𝜃=𝜔𝑡
Moment of Inertia of the system along one direction (One component of quadrupole moment tensor)
=m1(r1cos𝜃)2+m2(r2cos𝜃)2
=(m1r12+m2r22)cos2𝜃
=(𝑚1(𝑚2𝑟𝑚1+𝑚2)2+𝑚2(𝑚1𝑟𝑚1+𝑚2)2)𝑐𝑜𝑠2(𝜔𝑡)
=𝑚1𝑚2𝑚1+𝑚2𝑟2(1+cos(2𝜔𝑡)2)
=𝜇𝑟22(1+cos(2𝜔𝑡))
=𝜇𝑟22(1+cos(𝜔𝑒𝑡))
Where, 𝜔𝑒 is the angular frequency of the system.
[Similarly, the moment of inertia in other directions (Other components of the quadrupole moment tensor) are trigonometric functions of 2𝜔𝑡.] ∴𝜔𝑒=2𝜔
𝜔𝑒 is the angular frequency with which the quadrupole moment (moment of inertia here) changes, which is the same as the frequency of emission of gravitational waves.
Therefore, the frequency of emission of gravitational waves is twice the orbital angular frequency.
Let us express the Power radiated by gravitational wave in terms of only angular frequency 𝜔 and the masses in the binary system ⇒𝑃𝐺𝑊=325𝐺𝜇2𝑟4𝜔6𝑐5 𝑝𝑢𝑡𝑡𝑖𝑛𝑔 𝑟=(𝐺(𝑚1+𝑚2)𝜔2)1/3 ⇒𝑃𝐺𝑊=𝐺𝜇2𝜔6𝑐5(𝐺(𝑚1+𝑚2)𝜔2)4/3 ⇒𝑃𝐺𝑊=𝐺7/3𝜇2𝜔10/3(𝑚1+𝑚2)4/3𝑐5 ⇒𝑃𝐺𝑊=325(𝐺7𝜇6𝜔10(𝑚1+𝑚2)4𝑐15)1/3
Now, we have already derived the relation between the energy of the system and the orbital angular frequency 𝜔 ⇒ 𝐸=−12(𝐺𝑚1𝑚2𝜔)2/3.𝜇1/3
Differentiating both sides with respect to time ⇒𝑑𝐸𝑑𝑡=−13(𝐺𝑚1𝑚2)2/3.(𝜇𝜔)1/3𝑑𝜔𝑑𝑡 ⇒−𝑑𝐸𝑑𝑡=13(𝐺𝑚1𝑚2)2/3.(𝜇𝜔)1/3𝑑𝜔𝑑𝑡
The Power of the gravitational waves emitted is the first derivative of 𝑃𝐺𝑊=−𝑑𝐸𝑑𝑡 ⇒𝑃𝐺𝑊=13(𝐺𝑚1𝑚2)2/3.(𝜇𝜔)1/3𝑑𝜔𝑑𝑡 ⇒𝑃𝐺𝑊=325𝐺𝜇2𝑟4𝜔6𝑐5=13(𝐺𝑚1𝑚2)2/3.(𝜇𝜔)1/3𝑑𝜔𝑑𝑡 ⇒325𝐺𝜇2𝑟4𝜔6𝑐5=13(𝐺𝑚1𝑚2)2/3.(𝜇𝜔)1/3𝑑𝜔𝑑𝑡 ⇒965𝐺𝜇2𝑟4𝜔6(𝐺𝑚1𝑚2)2/3.(𝜇𝜔)1/3𝑐5=𝑑𝜔𝑑𝑡
⇒965𝐺1/3𝜇5/3𝑟4𝜔17/3(𝑚1𝑚2)2/3𝑐5=𝑑𝜔𝑑𝑡 𝑝𝑢𝑡𝑡𝑖𝑛𝑔 𝑟=(𝐺(𝑚1+𝑚2)𝜔2)1/3 ⇒(965𝐺1/3𝜇5/3𝜔17/3(𝑚1𝑚2)2/3𝑐5).(𝐺(𝑚1+𝑚2)𝜔2)4/3=𝑑𝜔𝑑𝑡 ⇒(965𝐺5/3𝜇5/3𝜔11/3𝑐5).((𝑚1+𝑚2)4/3(𝑚1𝑚2)2/3)=𝑑𝜔𝑑𝑡 ⇒(965𝐺5/3𝜇5/3𝜔11/3𝑐5).(1𝜇)5/3.(𝑚1𝑚2(𝑚1+𝑚2)1/3)=𝑑𝜔𝑑𝑡 ⇒(965𝐺5/3𝜔11/3𝑐5).(𝑚1𝑚2(𝑚1+𝑚2)1/3)=𝑑𝜔𝑑𝑡 ⇒𝑚1𝑚2(𝑚1+𝑚2)1/3=(596𝑐5𝐺5/3𝜔11/3)𝑑𝜔𝑑𝑡 ⇒(𝑚1𝑚2(𝑚1+𝑚2)1/3)3/5=(596)3/5(𝑐3𝐺𝜔11/5)(𝑑𝜔𝑑𝑡)3/5 ⇒𝑀𝑐ℎ𝑖𝑟𝑝=(𝑚1𝑚2(𝑚1+𝑚2)1/3)3/5 ⇒𝑀𝑐ℎ𝑖𝑟𝑝=(596)3/5(𝑐3𝐺)𝜔−11/5𝜔̇3/5
Now, we need to express Chirp Mass in terms of the frequency of emitted gravitational radiation and its temporal derivative
The frequency of radiation emitted is twice of the orbital angular frequency ω ∴𝜔=2𝜋𝑓𝑜𝑟𝑏𝑖𝑡𝑎𝑙=𝜋𝑓𝑒𝑚𝑖𝑡𝑡𝑒𝑑 ⇒𝑑𝜔𝑑𝑡=𝜋𝑑𝑓𝑒𝑚𝑖𝑡𝑡𝑒𝑑𝑑𝑡 ⇒𝑀𝑐ℎ𝑖𝑟𝑝=(596)3/5(𝑐3𝐺)(𝜋𝑓𝑒)−11/5(𝜋𝑓𝑒̇)3/5 ⇒𝑀𝑐ℎ𝑖𝑟𝑝=(596)3/5(𝑐3𝐺)𝜋8/5 𝑓𝑒−11/5 𝑓̇

Intensity can be related to power as: 𝐼𝐺𝑊=𝛾𝑃𝐺𝑊𝑑2
Where, 𝛾 is a constant and d is the distance of Gravitational wave detector from the source ∴𝐼𝐺𝑊∝ 𝐺𝜔6𝜇2𝑟4 𝑐5𝑑2 ⇒𝐼𝐺𝑊=𝜋2 𝐺𝜔6𝜇2𝑟4 𝑐5𝑑2
Now, rearranging the above equation ⇒𝑑2=𝜋2 𝐺𝜔6𝜇2𝑟4 𝑐5𝐼𝐺𝑊 ⇒𝑑=(𝜋2 𝐺𝜔6𝜇2𝑟4 𝑐5𝐼𝐺𝑊)1/2
Using the waveform we have drawn and Figure 1 the distance to our source is ⇒𝑑>1 𝑏𝑖𝑙𝑙𝑖𝑜𝑛 𝐿𝑖𝑔ℎ𝑡 𝑌𝑒𝑎𝑟𝑠
